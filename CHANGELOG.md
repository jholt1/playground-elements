### Changed

- [**BREAKING**] Renaming and major refactor of elements to allow them to be
  more easily used independently. The new elements are:

  - `<playground-layout>`: A single editor with file-selection bar and preview
    in side-by-side layout. If a different layout is required, the editor and
    preview elements can instead be used directly, along with a project element.
    New equivalent of what used to be `<code-sample-editor>`.

  - `<playground-project>`: New purely abstract element that coordinates between
    the service worker, editor elements, and preview elements.

  - `<playground-editor>`: An editor with file-selection bar, tied to a project
    element. New equivalent to the left-hand-side side of what used to be
    `<code-sample-editor>`.

  - `<playground-preview>`: A rendered HTML preview window, tied to a project
    element. New equivalent to the right-hand-side of what used to be
    `<code-sample-preview>`.

  - `<playground-codemirror>`: A pure CodeMirror editor, mostly unchanged from
    `<codemirror-editor>`.

  Example usage without `<playground-layout>`:

  ```html
  <playground-project
    id="myProject"
    project-src="/demo/typescript/project.json"
  ></playground-project>
  <playground-editor project="myProject"></playground-editor>
  <playground-preview project="myProject"></playground-preview>
  ```

  The `project` property can either be an ID in the host scope (as shown above)
  or a direct reference to a `<playground-project>` element (which would allow
  the elements to live in different scopes).

- Downgraded from CodeMirror v6 to v5 in order to gain support for nested
  highlighting of HTML and CSS inside JS/TS. See
  https://github.com/lezer-parser/javascript/issues/3. Will upgrade back to 6
  once support is ready.

- The caret is now only displayed when an editor is on focus (previously it was
  always displayed).

- The `<playground-layout>` side-by-side layout is now consistently 70%/30%
  (widths can be changed using the `editor` and `preview` CSS shadow parts).

### Added

- Add syntax highlighting of TypeScript files.

- Add syntax highlighting of nested HTML and CSS inside JS/TS.

- Add `filename` property/attribute to `<playground-editor>` which allows
  getting and setting the currently selected file.

- Add `noFilePicker` property (`no-file-picker` attribute) to
  `<playground-editor>` which disables the top file selection tab-bar.

- Add `lineNumbers` property (`line-numbers` attribute) to
  `<playground-layout>`, `<playground-editor>`, and `<playground-codemirror>`
  which enables the left-hand-side gutter with line numbers. Off by default.

- Add a `<slot>` to `<playground-editor>` which will be displayed until the file
  is loaded. This facilitates pre-rendering syntax-highlighted code before both
  the element has upgraded, and before the project file has been fetched.

- Add a `<slot>` to `<playground-preview>` which will be displayed until the
  preview iframe has loaded for the first time. This facilitates pre-rendering
  preview HTML both before both the element has upgraded, and before the live
  preview first renders.

- Add `label` property and attribute to project files. When set, the file picker
  will display this label instead of the filename.

- An animated progress bar now displays when a preview is loading.

- Added CSS Shadow Parts:

  - `<playground-editor>`: `file-picker`
  - `<playground-preview>`: `preview-toolbar`, `preview-location`,
    `preview-reload-button`, `preview-loading-indicator`
  - `<playground-layout>`: `editor`, `preview`, `file-picker`,
    `preview-toolbar`, `preview-location`, `preview-reload-button`,
    `preview-loading-indicator`

- Added CSS Custom Properties:

  - `--playground-code-font-family`
  - `--playground-code-font-size`
  - `--playground-editor-background-color`
  - `--playground-file-picker-background-color`
  - `--playground-file-picker-foreground-color`
  - `--playground-preview-toolbar-background-color`
  - `--playground-preview-toolbar-foreground-color`
  - `--playground-border`
  - `--playground-highlight-color`
  - `--playground-bar-height`

- Added `theme` property to `<playground-layout>`, `<playground-editor>`, and
  `<playground-codemirror>`, which sets the theme (currently only `default`,
  `monokai`, `ambiance`, `ayu-mirage` are available, but a way to load other
  themes will follow).

- Previews will now automatically reload on changes (0.5 second debounce).

- Added `readonly` property/attribute to `<playground-codemirror>` which
  disables the ability to edit.
